## Namaste, I’m the face behind CloudShetra ☁️

I’m a Salesforce consultant, solution architect, and AppExchange tinkerer who loves solving real business problems with smart, scalable solutions. With over a decade of hands-on experience in CRM, cloud, and integration strategy, I launched **CloudShetra** as a space to share insights, practical tips, and bold perspectives on building with Salesforce.

This blog isn’t just another tech site—it’s my digital **kshetra** (realm) where cloud conversations, design patterns, platform hacks, and industry trends come to life.
